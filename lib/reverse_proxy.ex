defmodule ReverseProxy do
  @moduledoc """
  A Plug based, reverse proxy server.

  `ReverseProxy` can act as a standalone service or as part of a plug
  pipeline in an existing application.

  From [Wikipedia](https://wikipedia.org/wiki/Reverse_proxy):

  > In computer networks, a reverse proxy is a type of proxy server
  > that retrieves resources on behalf of a client from one or more
  > servers. These resources are then returned to the client as
  > though they originated from the proxy server itself. While a
  > forward proxy acts as an intermediary for its associated clients
  > to contact any server, a reverse proxy acts as an intermediary
  > for its associated servers to be contacted by any client.
